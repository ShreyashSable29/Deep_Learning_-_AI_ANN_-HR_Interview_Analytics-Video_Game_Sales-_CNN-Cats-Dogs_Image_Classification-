# Deep_Learning_-_AI_ANN_-HR_Interview_Analytics-Video_Game_Sales-_CNN-Cats-Dogs_Image_Classification-
In this project ANN model is build on the Prediction of HR Interview Analysis and Video Game SalesmAnalysis and CNN Model is build on  Cats &amp; Dogs Image Classification.

## Task 1 :-
1)	Use the Dataset named HR Interview Analytics to predict the Status of the candidate (0 is not accepted and 1 is accepted). Build an Artificial Neural Network to predict the Status.

## Task 2 :-
2)	Use the below given url to build a CNN model to predict whether the given image is dog or cat. You can use Kaggle notebooks to build the model. Once the model is build, take a random image of a cat or dog from the test data and predict it using the model. 

## You can Download the Data Set from below link :-

## Task 3 :-
3)	Use the dataset named video_game_sales to predict the global sales, using artificial neural network. Use appropriate data preprocessing techniques to clean the data.
